**Description of the project and its functionality**

This project gives you an idea on significance of the Silk Road. For more than 20 centuries it was bridging East and West, China and Europe, and everything in between. You will read about goods transported along those routes, as well as deseases and even religions.
A number of functions are implemented here, such as changing the characteristics of elements when hovering the cursor, relevant links to websites corresponding to the content are connected, and, perhaps, the main thing is the implementation of adaptive layout for different screen sizes. Also, the work required the inclusion of new fonts
In Figma, we have placed a layout that shows how the project should look on the most common screen resolutions.

**Used technologies**

- Working with the Figma application.
- Using grid-building grids.
- Operating with relative units of measurement for setting dimensions.
